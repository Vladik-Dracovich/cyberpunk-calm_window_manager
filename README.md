This is a cyberpunk themed CWM config with some decent bindings. 
Work in progress, but I aim for a good minimal Dzen status bar, with rofi and picom out the box.

Still a bit early and may just remove or disable the install script (Use at your own discretion, if in doubt, write and copy the parts you like to build your config, I don't care).
